    <p>I`ll tell you how to knit with a hook the ladybug with removable backpack. Without this backpack it can become a cute small fly in a moment.If you are ready to
        make experiments with different colors, you can make some different bugs – easy and
        fun with one master class.
    </p>
    <p>Row begin marker can shift to the right on hook knitting.
        I`ll tell if you need to pay attention to begin of row.
        Size of your own toy may be different from mine.
        All details should be knitted spiral without lifting, unless otherwise
        indicated. I am binding arms and legs in this toy, that`s why you
        need to knit all the details of arm and hands before knitting the body.
        I recommend you to use invisible deductions. This method gets you
        rid from small holes when knitting. It is that you are knitting
        deduction for front semi-loops, not both.
